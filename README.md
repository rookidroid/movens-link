# Movens Link

Desktop controller for the [Movens](https://github.com/rookidroid/movens) 5-axis robot arm over WiFi.
It talks to the ESP32 firmware's REST API (`FIRMWARE/movens`) and adds positions, sequences and a
3D view with mouse teleoperation.

![Control view](docs/control.png)

## Features

**What the firmware's control page does:**
- Arm state: tool pose, joint angles and steps, and soft-limit meters.
- Go to origin and the E-stop (STOP button or <kbd>Esc</kbd>).
- Tool (XYZ) stepping and go-to-pose with a reach check, and joint stepping and targets in degrees: in the
  panel that comes up when the gripper or a link is clicked in the 3D view (see below).
- Gripper servo.

Setting the arm up stays with the firmware: calibrate each joint, with its speed and acceleration, on the
robot's own page at `http://<robot address>/calibrate`. Where a joint is not calibrated the app links there,
and it reads the calibration again when its window comes back to the front.

**Simulation first:** the app starts in simulation mode and never contacts the robot until you press
**Connect** (in the panel under the connection chip at the top of the view). Every feature, including the 3D
view, positions and sequences, then drives a built-in virtual arm, so motions can be prepared and rehearsed offline.
Disconnecting stops the arm and goes back to the simulation. If the robot stops answering while connected, the
app shows **Offline** and stays on the robot (it never silently switches to the simulation).

**New:**
- **3D view.** Fills the window; the controls lie over it as panels that fold away and stay as you left
  them. A live model of the arm and a translucent *ghost* for previews.
  - Trail of the tool path.
  - Camera presets (Iso, Front, Side, Top).
- **Mouse teleoperation** in the 3D view, picked by clicking the arm. Click anywhere else to go back to orbiting; a preview stays up until you move to it or reset it:
  - *Tool drag*: click the gripper, then drag the gizmo on the fingertip. IK solves the arm live; past the edge of reach or a joint limit, the gizmo and the ghost (now orange) stop at the nearest reachable position. Drag the ring around the fingertip, or use Shift + wheel, to change the pitch.
  - *Joint drag*: click a link to pick its joint, then drag the ring around the joint axis. Blue **+** and orange **−** arrows on the ring show which way the joint's angle grows, as in [Joint directions](#joint-directions).
  - Either brings up a panel with the same target in numbers: type a value, or step it with the **−** / **+** buttons by the chosen step (1, 5, 10 or 50 mm or degrees). *Snap drag* makes dragging move in whole steps too.
  - *Preview* mode moves the arm on **Move** or <kbd>Enter</kbd>. *Live* mode follows the drag, throttled to one request at a time at a capped speed.
- **Positions** (left, under the arm's state) and **Sequences** (right) are panels beside the arm
  they drive.
- **Positions:**
  - Save the current arm position, or enter a tool pose or joint angles by hand.
  - Edit, convert between joints and tool pose, preview as a ghost, and go there at a chosen speed.
- **Sequences:** chain *move* steps (position, speed %, dwell), *gripper* steps and *wait* steps.
  - Reorder steps by dragging, and set a repeat count.
  - Validate the sequence and preview its tool path in 3D.
  - Run, pause/resume, single-step, run from a step, and stop.
  - Each move waits until all joints have stopped before the next step starts.
- Import/export of the library as JSON.

## Requirements

- The robot firmware with the `POST /movejoints` endpoint and the `speed` option on `/movepose` (current
  `movens` firmware). Older firmware still works for everything except joint-space positions and sequence speeds.
- To connect, join the arm's WiFi access point **movens** (password `movens_1234`), press **Connect** and
  confirm the address (default `192.168.4.1`, remembered between sessions).

## Joint directions

Angles are in degrees and match the firmware's arm model (`movens_config.h`). With every joint at 0° the arm
points straight up. Each diagram below shows a base pose (solid) and the same pose with one joint turned
**+** (blue) and **−** (orange). Calibrate each joint so that its + direction matches. J1 only turns through
0° to 180°, so its diagram starts at 90°.

| Joint | + direction |
|---|---|
| J1 base | Counter-clockwise seen from above. Range 0° to 180° (0° = arm faces +X) |
| J2 shoulder | Leans the arm forward (toward +X at J1 = 0) |
| J3 elbow | Bends the forearm forward |
| J4 wrist roll | Right-handed about the forearm (thumb toward the gripper) |
| J5 wrist pitch | Tips the gripper forward, toward the bend of the arm |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev           # Electron app with hot reload (starts in simulation)
npm run mock          # stand-alone simulated robot over HTTP on localhost:8080 (-- --uncalibrated
                      # for an arm that is not set up); connect the app to localhost:8080 to test the real path
npm run web           # renderer only, in a browser at localhost:5180; Connect goes to the mock via a proxy
npm test              # unit tests (kinematics, simulator, sequence runner, storage)
npm run typecheck
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run format        # Prettier (format:check to only check; CSS and HTML are left as written)
npm run diagrams      # redraw the joint direction diagrams in docs/joints/ from the 3D model
npm run dist          # Windows installer + portable exe in dist/
npm run dist:mac      # macOS dmg + zip (x64 and arm64), on a Mac
npm run dist:linux    # Linux AppImage + tar.gz (x64 and arm64)
```

CI runs lint, typecheck, the format check and the unit tests on every push and pull request, and builds the
app for Windows (installer, portable exe), macOS (dmg, zip) and Linux (AppImage, tar.gz), downloadable from the
run. To publish a release, set `version` in `package.json`, then push a matching tag
(`git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`): the build attaches all of them to a GitHub release. The macOS build
is not signed with an Apple certificate or notarized, so on first launch right-click the app and choose **Open**. Dependabot opens weekly update PRs for npm packages and the workflows' actions.

The positions and sequences library is stored in `%APPDATA%\Movens Link\library.json`.

### Layout

| Path | |
|---|---|
| `src/main/` | Electron main process: robot HTTP client (`robot.ts`), JSON storage (`store.ts`) |
| `src/preload/` | `window.movens` bridge (IPC) |
| `src/shared/kinematics.ts` | Port of the firmware's `kinematics.cpp`. Keep `KIN` in sync with `movens_config.h` |
| `src/renderer/lib/` | API/polling core, 3D view (`arm3d.ts`, its floor in `floor.ts`), sequence runner, library |
| `src/renderer/styles/` | `app.css` (base styles, from the firmware's pages), `link.css` (additions), `hud.css` (the full-window 3D view and the panels over it) |
| `src/renderer/views/` | Control (with its Positions and Sequences panels) and the connection panel |
| `src/shared/simRobot.ts` | Simulated robot (the part of the firmware's REST API the app uses), used by simulation mode and the mock |
| `scripts/mock-robot.ts` | HTTP wrapper around the simulated robot |
| `scripts/joint-diagrams/` | Draws `docs/joints/*.png` with the 3D view's arm model (`src/renderer/lib/armModel.ts`) |

All robot requests go through the main process because the firmware's POST replies carry no CORS headers.
